# Getting started
### Account creation: 
This step is very simple, since the RedCap Survey Platform lies within the same domain as VinGroup’s email accounts. This allows the platform to link the user’s email to a new account using the same email as the user’s personal email. However, users must still contact VinUniversity’s technical administrators to confirm their account creation to utilize the platform and provide them with their account password, which can then be changed however necessary. The account setup is quite straightforward, all that is needed from this point is setting up a simple 2-step authentication with Microsoft Authenticator or the user’s personal email.

### Project creation:
Once an account has been created, the user can start using our platform as needed and to do so, they must start a project. The platform has a plethora of project types for the user to choose from, and it is advised that they choose one that is closest to their purposes since the platform will provide them with the necessary tools needed for that type of project. Regardless of which project type the user chose, they will now be able to access their very own project created via the VinUni RedCap Survey Platform

# Project Initialization
At this point, the user will be at the project setup phase, where they can customize the functions that they would like to have and ones that they would like to do without. This is to further enhance user experience with the platform and ensure that the user has access to, but not limited to, the functions that they know that are needed for their project. Once done, the user can push their project into the development phase.

# Survey creation and distribution
This section outlines the main function of our platform, for other more technical functions for your projects, please refer to the RedCap official documentation for further details to aid your project

### Survey creation: 
To create a survey form, the user can utilize the platform’s built-in survey designer tool, listed as “designer” found on the tool tab on the left-hand side of the webpage. Once here, the functions are quite self-explanatory, the user can either choose to create their own survey form using a built-in application or they can import a premade form from their local device. 

Regarding the built-in application for survey design, the application does a great job at explaining how to format your own personalized survey form already, for further queries, please refer to the documentations provided by the application.

### Survey distribution:
Once the user has created their own survey form(s), they can use the ‘survey distribution tools’ and simply extract a link or QR code to send out. They can also email the link directly to their surveyees using this tool. That is it, once the survey has been filled in and submitted, the user can find the results under the ‘record status dashboard’ tab. 

# Conclusion
This is the main function of VinUni RedCap Survey Platform, however, as mentioned this platform provides a huge plethora of functionalities that is curated for the users’ research purposes. Thus, there are many tools that are not listed in this manual but their utility can be found in the RedCap’s documentation on the platform itself. With that being said, the functions on the platform are fairly easy to understand but can be confusing since there are just that many functions. The user is advised to take their time to learn and understand the functions at their disposal for the best information-gathering experience for research.
